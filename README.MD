This project has been developed in the distributed systems sources
(SDIS) at Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto. The current
release is not stable and may have bugs.

the files. Please download at (BUDIBOX WEBSITE)

install the desktop client and place your files in the
Budibox folder to start the synchronization. On the website,
you can login and see your list of files, peers and change

your files. All the files are encrypted in the peers.
